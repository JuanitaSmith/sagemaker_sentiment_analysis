# SageMaker Deployment Project

This project was completed as part of Udacity 'Machine Learning Enigineer' Nanodegree.
The goal was to practise automated deployment of models and end points in Sagemaker to support sentiment analysis

The notebook and Python files provided here, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project was using SageMaker and Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost

The initial project was cloned from https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment.git
