# SageMaker Deployment Project

This project was completed as part of Udacity 'Machine Learning Engineer' Nanodegree.
The goal was to practise automated deployment of models and end points in Sagemaker to support sentiment analysis

The notebook and Python files provided here, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project is using SageMaker deployment techniques and Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, and rely on AWS services like AWS API gateway, AWS lambda to be called from the webapp
